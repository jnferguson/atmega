Basic backup of atmega related code; i think all it does is blink LEDs and handle a keypad. My initial attempts at learning to program said microcontrollers.

(DHS is to science as the Catholic church was to Galileo. They're the only ones allowed to have it because absolutely everything might be dangerous, except them. Anytime I start working on electronics anything my life suddenly becomes this chaotic array of fires to be extinguished until I'm no longer working on anything electronics based.)
